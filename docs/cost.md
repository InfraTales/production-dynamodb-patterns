## Cost Optimization Strategies

- Use Savings Plans or Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Enable auto-scaling with conservative scale-in policies
- Use DynamoDB on-demand for dev, provisioned for production
- Leverage S3 Intelligent-Tiering for infrequently accessed data
- Review Cost Explorer weekly for anomalies
