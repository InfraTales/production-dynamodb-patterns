## 🎯 Overview

Lambda + DynamoDB + API Gateway with Cognito auth across 3 environments.

**Pillar:** SERVERLESS — part of the [InfraTales AWS Reference Architecture series](https://infratales.com).
**Target audience:** advanced cloud and DevOps engineers building production AWS infrastructure.

> 📐 See [`diagrams/`](diagrams/) for full architecture, sequence, and data flow diagrams.

> Architecture diagrams in [`diagrams/`](diagrams/) show the full service topology (architecture, sequence, and data flow).
> The [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) file covers component responsibilities and data flow.

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

- Higher CDK complexity vs raw CloudFormation
- DynamoDB cost at scale

> For the full reasoning behind each decision — cost models, alternatives considered, and what breaks at scale — see the **[Full Guide on InfraTales](https://infratales.com/test-post/)**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
node >= 18
npm >= 9
aws-cdk >= 2.x
AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
```

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InfraTales/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
npm install
```

### Bootstrap (first time per account/region)

```bash
cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_REGION
```

---

## 📦 Deployment

```bash
# Review what will be created
cdk diff --context env=dev

# Deploy to dev
cdk deploy --context env=dev

# Deploy to production (requires broadening approval)
cdk deploy --context env=prod --require-approval broadening
```

> ⚠️ Always run `cdk diff` before deploying to production. Review all IAM and security group changes.
